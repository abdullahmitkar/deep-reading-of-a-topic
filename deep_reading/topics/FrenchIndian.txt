The French and Indian War (1754–1763) was the North American chapter of the Seven Years' War.
The name refers to the two main enemies of the British: The royal French forces and the various American Indian forces allied with them.
The conflict, the fourth such colonial war between the kingdoms of France and Great Britain, resulted in the British conquest of all of New France east of the Mississippi River, as well as Spanish Florida.
The outcome was one of the most significant developments in a century of Anglo-French conflict.
To compensate its ally, Spain, for its loss of Florida, France ceded its control of French Louisiana west of the Mississippi.
France's colonial presence north of the Caribbean was reduced to the tiny islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon.
The victory would ultimately prove to be a Pyrrhic one for the British, as the debt it incurred winning the war would lead directly to a series of taxation fights with the colonists that would spark the War of Independence.
	
Naming the war
The conflict is known by several names.
In British North America, wars were often named after the sitting British monarch, such as King William's War or Queen Anne's War.
Because there had already been a King George's War in the 1740s, British colonists named the second war in King George's reign after their opponents, and thus it became known as the French and Indian War.
This traditional name remains standard in the United States, although it obscures the fact that American Indians fought on both sides of the conflict.
American historians generally use the traditional name or the European title (the Seven Years' War), and have also invented other, less frequently used names for the war, including the Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire.
In Great Britain and France, the North American theater of the Seven Years' War war usually has no special name, and so the entire worldwide conflict is known as the Seven Years' War (or the Guerre de sept ans).
The "Seven Years" refers to events in Europe, from the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763.
These dates do not correspond with the actual fighting in North America, where the fighting between the two colonial powers was largely concluded in six years, from the Jumonville Glen skirmish in 1754, to the capture of Montreal in 1760.
In Canada, both French- and English-speaking Canadians refer to it as the Seven Years' War (Guerre de Sept Ans) or the War of the Conquest (Guerre de la Conquête), since it is the war in which New France was conquered by the British and became part of the British Empire.
This war was also known as the Forgotten War.
Impetus for war
Territorial expansion
There were numerous causes for the French and Indian War, which began less than a decade after France and Britain had fought on opposing sides in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748).
Both New France and New England wanted to expand their territories to enhance fur trading and other pursuits that matched their economic interests.
Using trading posts and forts, both the British and the French claimed the vast territory between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, known as the Ohio Country.
English claims resulted from royal grants which had no definite western boundaries.
The French claims resulted from La Salle's claiming the Mississippi River for France–its drainage area includes the Ohio River Valley.
In order to secure these claims, both European powers took advantage of Native American factions to protect their territories and to keep each other from growing too strong.
Newfoundland's Grand Banks were fertile fishing grounds and coveted by both sides.
The conclusion of this war would see France keeping only the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, allowing them access to the Grand Banks to this day.
Religious ideology
The English colonists also feared papal influence in North America, as New France was administered by French governors and Roman Catholic hierarchy, and missionaries such as Armand de La Richardie were active during this period.
For the predominantly Protestant British settlers, French control over North America could have represented a threat to their religious and other freedoms provided by English law.
Likewise, the French feared the anti-Catholicism prevalent among English holdings.
In this period, Catholicism was still enduring persecution under English law.
Céloron's expedition
In June 1747, Roland-Michel Barrin de La Galissonière, the Governor-General of New France, ordered Pierre-Joseph Céloron to lead an expedition to the Ohio Country with the objective of removing British influence from the area.
Céloron was also to confirm the allegiance of the Native Americans inhabiting the territory to the French crown.
Céloron's expedition consisted of 213 soldiers of the Troupes de la marine (French Marines), who were transported by 23 canoes.
The expedition left Lachine, on June 15, 1749, and two days later reached Fort Frontenac.
The expedition then continued along the shoreline of present-day Lake Erie.
At Chautauqua Portage (Barcelona, New York), the expedition moved inland to the Allegheny River.
The expedition headed south to the Ohio River at present-day Pittsburgh, and Céloron buried lead plates engraved with the French claim to the Ohio Country.
Whenever British merchants or fur-traders encountered the French, they were informed that they were on French territory illegally and told to leave the Ohio Country.
When Céloron's expedition arrived at Logstown, the Native Americans in the area informed Céloron that they owned the Ohio Country and that they would trade with the British regardless of what the French told them to do.
The French continued their expedition.
At its farthest point south, Céloron's expedition reached the junction between the Ohio River and the Miami River.
The junction lay just south of the village of Pickawillany, where the Miami Chief, "Old Britain" (as styled by Céloron), lived.
When Céloron arrived at Pickawillany, he informed "Old Britain" of the "dire consequences" of the elderly chief continuing to trade with the British.
"Old Britain" ignored the warning.
After his meeting with Old Britain, Céloron and his expedition began the trip home.
They did not reach Montreal until November 10, 1749.
The best summary of the expedition's findings came from Céloron himself.
In his report, Céloron wrote: "All I can say is that the Natives of these localities are very badly disposed towards the French, and are entirely devoted to the English.
I don't know in what way they could be brought back.
"
Langlade's expedition
On March 17, 1752, the Governor-General of New France, Marquis de la Jonquière died.
His temporary replacement was Charles le Moyne de Longueuil.
It was not until July 1, 1752, that Ange Duquense de Menneville arrived in New France to take over the post.
In the spring of 1752, Longueuil dispatched an expedition to the Ohio River area.
The expedition was led by Charles Michel de Langlade, an officer in the Troupes de la marine.
Langlade was given 300 men comprised of members of the Ottawa and French-Canadians.
His objective was to punish the Miami people of Pickawillany for not following Céloron's orders to cease trading with the British.
At dawn on June 21, 1752, the French war party attacked the British trading center at Pickawillany, killing fourteen people of the Miami nation, including "Old Britain.
" The expedition then returned home.
Marin's expedition
In the spring of 1753, Paul Marin de la Malgue was given command of a 2,000 man force of Troupes de la Marine and Aboriginals.
His orders were to protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British.
Marin followed the route that Céloron had mapped out four years previously.
The main difference in the two expeditions was that, whereas Céloron had buried lead plates, Marin was constructing and garrisoning forts.
The first fort that was constructed by Paul Marin was Fort Presque Isle (Erie, Pennsylvania) on Lake Erie's south shore.
He then had a road built to the headwaters of Rivière aux Boeuf.
Marin then constructed a second fort at Le Boeuf (Waterford, Pennsylvania).
This fort was designed to guard the headwaters of the Rivière aux Boeuf.
Tanaghrisson's proclamation
On September 3, 1753, Tanaghrisson (d.
1754), Chief of the Mingo, arrived at Fort Le Boeuf.
Tanaghrisson hated the French because, as legend had it, the French had killed and eaten his father.
Tanaghrisson told Marin, "I shall strike at whoever…" threatening the French.
The show of force by the French had alarmed the Iroquois in the area.
They sent Mohawk runners to William Johnson's manor in Upper New York.
Johnson, known to the Iroquois as Warraghiggey, meaning, "He who does big business," had become a respected member of the Iroquois Confederacy in the area.
In 1746, Johnson was made a colonel of the Iroquois, and later a colonel of the Western New York Militia.
At Albany, New York, there was a meeting between Governor Clinton of New York and Chief Hendrick, as well as other officials from a handful of American colonies.
Chief Hendrick insisted that the British abide by their obligations and block French expansion.
When an unsatisfactory response was offered by Clinton, Chief Hendrick proclaimed that the "Covenant Chain," a long-standing friendly relationship between the Iroquois Confederacy and the British Crown, was broken.
Governor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia found himself in a predicament.
Many merchants had invested heavily in fur trading in Ohio.
If the French made good on their claim to the Ohio Country and drove out the British, then the Virginian merchants would lose a lot of money.
Dinwiddie could not possibly allow the loss of the Ohio Country to France.
To counter the French military presence in Ohio, in October 1753 Dinwiddie ordered Major George Washington of the Virginia militia to deliver a message to the commander of the French forces in the Ohio Country, Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre.
Washington, along with his interpreter Jacob Van Braam and several other men, left for Fort Le Boeuf on October 31.
A few days later, Washington and his party arrived at Wills Creek (Cumberland, Maryland).
Here Washington enlisted the help of Christopher Gist, a surveyor who was familiar with the area.
Washington and his party arrived at Logstown on November 24, 1753.
At Logstown, Washington met with Tanaghrisson, who was angry over the encroachment by the French military of his land.
Washington convinced Tanaghrisson to accompany his small group to Fort Le Boeuf.
On December 12, 1753, Washington and his men reached Fort Le Boeuf.
Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre invited Washington to dine with him that evening.
Over dinner, Washington presented Saint-Pierre with the letter from Dinwiddie that demanded an immediate French withdrawal from the Ohio Country.
Saint-Pierre was quite civil in his response, saying, "As to the Summons you send me to retire, I do not think myself obliged to obey it.
" The French explained to Washington that France's claim to the region was superior to that of the British, since René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle (1643–1687) had explored the Ohio Country nearly a century earlier.
Washington's party left Fort Le Boeuf early on December 16, 1753.
By January 16, 1754, they had arrived in Williamsburg, Virginia.
In his report, Washington stated, "The French had swept south.
" They had constructed and garrisoned forts at Presque Isle, Le Boeuf and Venango.
The French and Indian War was the last of four major colonial wars between the British, the French, and their Native American allies.
Unlike the previous three wars, the French and Indian War began on North American soil and then spread to Europe, where Britain and France continued fighting.
Britain officially declared war on France on May 15, 1756, marking the beginnings of the Seven Years' War in Europe.
Native Americans fought for both sides, but primarily alongside the French (with one exception—the Iroquois Confederacy—which sided with the American colonies and Britain).
The first major event of the war was in 1754.
Major George Washington, then twenty-one years of age, was sent to negotiate boundaries with the French, who did not give up their forts.
Washington led a group of Virginian (colonial) troops to confront the French at Fort Duquesne (present day Pittsburgh).
Washington stumbled upon the French at the Battle of Jumonville Glen (about six miles (10 km) NW of soon-to-be-established Fort Necessity), and in the ensuing skirmish, a French Officer (Joseph Coulon de Jumonville) was killed, news of which would have certainly provoked a strong French response.
Washington pulled back a few miles and established Fort Necessity.
The French forced Washington and his men to retreat.
Meanwhile, the Albany Congress was taking place as means to discuss further action.
Edward Braddock led a campaign against the French at Fort Duquesne in 1755; Washington was again among the British and colonial troops.
Braddock employed European tactics: bold, linear marches and firing formations.
This led to disaster at the Monongahela, where the French and natives, though heavily outmanned and outgunned (the British had a heavy cannon), used superior tactics (using the trees and bushes as cover) to gun down and rout the British.
Braddock was killed; Washington, despite four close calls, escaped unharmed, and led the survivors in retreat.
This stunning British defeat heralded a string of major French victories over the next few years, at Fort Oswego, Fort William Henry, Fort Duquesne, and Carillon, where veteran Montcalm famously defeated five times his number.
The sole British successes in the early years of the war came in 1755, at the Battle of Lake George, which secured the Hudson Valley; and in the taking of Fort Beauséjour (which protected the Nova Scotia frontier) by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Monckton.
An unfortunate consequence of the latter was the subsequent forced deportation of the Acadian population of Nova Scotia and the Beaubassin region of Acadia.
The year 1756 brought with it William Pitt, Secretary of State of Great Britain.
His leadership, and France's continued neglect of the North-American theater, eventually turned the tide in favor of the British.
The French were driven from many frontier posts such as Fort Niagara, and the key Fortress Louisbourg fell to the British in 1758.
In 1759, the Battle of the Plains of Abraham gave Quebec City to the British, who had to withstand a siege there after the Battle of Sainte-Foy a year later.
In September of 1760, Pierre François de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal, the King's Governor of New France, negotiated a surrender with British General Jeffrey Amherst.
General Amherst granted Vaudreuil's request that any French residents who chose to remain in the colony would be given freedom to continue worshiping in their Roman Catholic tradition, continued ownership of their property, and the right to remain undisturbed in their homes.
The British provided medical treatment for the sick and wounded French soldiers and French regular troops were returned to France aboard British ships with an agreement that they were not to serve again in the present war.
Though most of the North American fighting ended on September 8, 1760, when the Marquis de Vaudreuil surrendered Montreal—and effectively all of Canada—to Britain (one notable late battle allowed the capture of Spanish Havana by British and colonial forces in 1762), the war officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763.
The treaty resulted in France's loss of all its North American possessions east of the Mississippi (all of Canada was ceded to Britain) except Saint Pierre and Miquelon, two small islands off Newfoundland.
France regained the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, which had been occupied by the British.
The economic value of these islands to France was greater than that of Canada at the time, because of their rich sugar crops, and the islands were easier to defend.
The British, however, were happy to take New France, as defense was not an issue, and they already had many sources of sugar.
Spain gained Louisiana, including New Orleans, in compensation for its loss of Florida to the British.
Also, Britain gained control of French Canada, a colony containing approximately 65,000 French-speaking, Roman Catholic residents.
Early in the war, in 1755, the British had expelled French settlers from Acadia (some of whom eventually fled to Louisiana, creating the Cajun population).
Now at peace, and eager to secure control of its hard-won colony, Great Britain found itself obliged to make concessions to its newly conquered subjects; this was achieved with the Quebec Act of 1774.
The history of the Seven Years' War, particularly the siege of Québec and the death of British Brigadier General James Wolfe, generated a vast number of ballads, broadsides, images, maps and other printed materials, which testify to how this event continued to capture the imagination of the British public long after Wolfe's death in 1759.
The European theater of the war was settled by the Treaty of Hubertusburg on February 15, 1763.
The war changed economic, political, and social relations between Britain and its colonies.
It plunged Britain into debt, which the Crown chose to pay off with tax money from its colonies.
These taxes contributed to a series of contentious issues between the crown and the colonists that would ultimately lead to the American Revolutionary War.
French and Indian War, American phase of a worldwide nine years’ war (1754–63) fought between France and Great Britain.
(The more-complex European phase was the Seven Years’ War [1756–63].
) It determined control of the vast colonial territory of North America.
Three earlier phases of this extended contest for overseas mastery included King William’s War (1689–97), Queen Anne’s War (1702–13), and King George’s War (1744–48).
The French and Indian War began over the specific issue of whether the upper Ohio River valley was a part of the British Empire, and therefore open for trade and settlement by Virginians and Pennsylvanians, or part of the French Empire.
Behind this issue loomed an infinitely larger one, however: which national culture was to dominate the heart of North America.
Settlers of English extraction were in a preponderance in the coveted area, but French exploration, trade, and alliances with Native Americans predominated.
British territorial claims rested upon explorations of the North American continent by John Cabot in the latter part of the 15th century.
In the early 17th century, an English royal charter granted land within certain limits between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans to both the Virginia Company and the Plymouth Company.
In 1663 the province of Carolina was created to the south of Virginia, with a sea-to-sea grant; the Carolina charter was amended two years later, and the expanded territory would come to form the colonies of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.
Thus, all the lands to the south of French Canada and to the north of Spanish Florida, stretching from sea to sea, were claimed by England.
In conflict with this was France’s claim to the whole of the Mississippi valley, including the Ohio Valley, based upon the explorations of René-Robert Cavelier, sieur de la Salle.
Starting from Canada, La Salle moved through the Great Lakes and then, after descending the Mississippi River in 1682, took possession in the name of the king of France of all lands drained by the river and its tributaries.
French and Indian Wars (1689–1763) Collective name for four colonial wars in North America, fought between Great Britain and France with Native American nations fighting on both sides.
The aim of the wars in North America was for control of the e part of the continent, with ports and forts that controlled trade to the Old World.
King William's War (1689–97) ended inconclusively.
Queen Anne's War (1702–13) corresponds to the War of the Spanish Succession in Europe.
Britain gained Newfoundland, Acadia and Hudson Bay.
King George's War (1744–48) grew out of the War of the Austrian Succession.
It ended inconclusively.
The French and Indian War (1754–63) was the most significant conflict, forming part of the Seven Years' War.
British efforts (1754–55) to capture French forts in w America were unsuccessful.
After 1756, British resources improved, and forts at Louisburg and Duquesne (1758) were captured.
Ticonderoga fell in 1759.
In the battle for Québec on the Plains of Abraham (1759), both the French and English generals, Louis-Joseph de Montcalm and James Wolfe, were killed, but Britain emerged victorious.
In 1760, the British captured Montréal.
The Treaty of Paris (1763) established British control of Canada.
The capitulation of Montreal to British troops in September 1760 ended the French and Indian War in North America but ushered in a host of new problems for the British Empire.
Previously, when European powers ended wars they exchanged conquered colonial possessions with an eye to keeping a balance of power between their American empires.
This war, however, was different.
It had begun in North America in an Anglo-French dispute over control of the Ohio Valley.
British colonists, who had expended far more blood and treasure in this war than any prior one, were anxious for Britain to seize control of French Canada so that they might expand westward without threat of foreign reprisals.
In Britain some policymakers argued for restoring Canada to the French but keeping the Caribbean sugar colony Guadeloupe, which British forces had also taken during the war.
Others argued that Canada was far more valuable than a sugar colony because of its fur trade and the access it would provide to the continent's interior.
When the Peace of Paris was finally signed in 1763, the advocates for the retention of Canada won out.
By the terms of the treaty, Britain acquired all of France's North American possessions east of the Mississippi River.
In addition, Britain acquired Florida from Spain.
The balance of power in North America had shifted decisively in Britain's favor, but so too had the costs of governing and defending imperial possessions there.
Before the French and Indian War, British policymakers had looked upon the North American colonies chiefly as self-sustaining commercial enterprises, to be governed as cheaply as possible through the regulation of their trade.
After the Treaty of Paris, British North America became a vast imperial dominion containing British subjects, conquered foreigners, and Native Americans all in need of government and protection from each other and external enemies.
The chief consequence of the French and Indian War, therefore, was a reorientation in Britain's perception and administration of its American colonies.
This reorientation unfolded over the next dozen years, as British policymakers grappled with the expanded responsibilities and costs of their American empire.
Their efforts fell into three broad categories shaped by the Peace of Paris: the maintenance of a North American army, the management of Indian affairs, and the government of new territories and peoples.
The acquisition of Canada and Florida made the maintenance of British troops in North America after the war a fait accompli.
Colonial militias and provincial troops had proven themselves notoriously unreliable in garrison duty during the war, so British regulars were needed to police newly conquered subjects and to staff forts and posts abandoned by the French and Spanish.
The British ministry planned to maintain about 7,500 British troops in North America, at an estimated annual cost of £350,000.
This policy would add a substantial burden to a royal treasury already heavily indebted by the war effort.
In 1764 Prime Minister George Grenville introduced the Sugar Act to Parliament, the first of a series of taxation measures pursued by the British ministry over the following decade designed to shift a portion of this financial burden onto the shoulders of the colonists, who, according to Grenville and his successors, could well afford to pay for it.
The colonists, of course, saw it another way, and launched a series of protests, beginning with the Stamp Act riots in 1765, that condemned such measures as "taxation without representation.
"
Quartering of troops was another issue that arose out of the decision to maintain regular troops in America after the war.
When the effort to raise tax revenues in America stalled, Parliament passed Quartering Acts in 1765, 1766, and 1774 that required the American colonists to provide barracks and supplies for the troops.
Quartering had arisen as a point of contention during the French and Indian War in Massachusetts and New York, but local compromises and generous subsidies from the government ministry of William Pitt had helped paper over these differences.
With the passage of the Quartering Act of 1765, the issue arose again, this time in the context of parliamentary efforts to tax the colonists without their consent.
The colonial opposition to quartering intensified in 1768, when the ministry, in an attempt to cut expenses, ordered troops to vacate most western posts and relocate in eastern cities.
The administration of the army in North America after the French and Indian War was intertwined with British efforts to place Indian affairs under the centralized management of imperial officials.
The French had maintained an extensive network of commercial and military alliances with Indian nations in the Great Lakes, Ohio, and Mississippi regions, playing the role of a diplomatic "father" who supplied his "children" with presents of trade goods and helped mediate their relations with traders, missionaries, and other Indians.
The British inherited this role but played it very poorly.
General Jeffrey Amherst, commander in chief of the British forces in North America, regarded the Indians as conquered peoples rather than allies and ordered that the flow of diplomatic presents to them be stopped.
In May 1763 Anglo-Indian tensions created by Amherst's highhandedness erupted into a widespread and devastating frontier war known, after the American Ottawa chief, as Pontiac's War.
The violence and cost of this war spurred the British Board of Trade to expand the powers and responsibilities of the two superintendents for Indian affairs the crown had appointed during the French and Indian War.
According to a plan formulated in 1764, the Indian superintendents—William Johnson in the northern colonies and John Stuart in the southern colonies—would oversee all Indian land purchases, regulate the fur trade, and negotiate a boundary line between Indian and colonial territory.
The implementation of this new policy was stymied by the colonists' reluctance to follow the dictates of the crown's Indian superintendents.
In 1768 the ministry restored management of the fur trade to the individual colonial governments, which lowered the crown's expenses but also increased the exploitation and abuses that fueled Indian discontent along the frontier in the years preceding the American Revolution.
The British ministry's efforts to fund the army and pacify Indians in North America were directly related to the third major focus of policymaking initiated by the French and Indian War.
The territorial acquisitions of the war opened a vast new frontier to American land speculators and squatters anxious to exploit territory west of the Appalachian Mountains.
Even before the ink was dry on the Peace of Paris, settlers were pushing into the Ohio Country, over the objections of Indians who claimed that region as their own.
In the Proclamation of 1763, the British ministry tried to stem this tide by temporarily prohibiting settlement west of the Allegheny Mountains.
Over time, this injunction became more permanent as the Indian superintendents negotiated treaties to create a fixed boundary line between colonial and Indian populations.
Squatters ignored such restrictions, and well-connected land speculators lobbied the crown for land grants to establish new colonies in the continent's interior.
The British effort to impose control over its new western territories in North America came to a head in 1774 with Parliament's passage of the Quebec Act.
While the chief purpose of this legislation was to establish a plan of civil government in Canada, it extended the authority of the new Quebec government over the western territories ceded by the French in 1763.
Various provisions in the Quebec Act curtailed liberties Anglo-American colonists considered their birthright, including trial by jury and local government by elected assemblies.
Anglo-Americans interpreted these measures as an effort to impose French-style despotism over any new colonies established west of the Appalachians.
Historians have long argued over the significance of these policies in the coming of the American Revolution.
Some assert that the origins of the American Revolution lay in the western policy pursued by the British ministry after 1760, because this policy generated the need for the taxes that proved so obnoxious to the colonists.
Others discount the impact of such measures as the Proclamation of 1763 and Quebec Act, especially when compared to the widespread protests ignited by the Stamp Act, Townshend Duties, and Tea Act.
Regardless, the French and Indian War fundamentally changed Britain's approach to governing its North American colonies.
The efforts to maintain a North American army, centralize Indian affairs, and manage a vast and unruly frontier no doubt contributed to the souring of Anglo-American relations after 1763 and helped define the issues upon which the empire split apart in 1776.
The French and Indian War (1754–1763) was the North American chapter of the Seven Years' War.
The name refers to the two main enemies of the British: the royal French forces and the various American Indian forces allied with them.
The conflict, the fourth such colonial war between the kingdoms of France and Great Britain, resulted in the British conquest of all of New France east of the Mississippi River, as well as Spanish Florida.
The outcome was one of the most significant developments in a century of Anglo-French conflict.
To compensate its ally, Spain, for its loss of Florida, France ceded its control of French Louisiana west of the Mississippi.
France's colonial presence north of the Caribbean was reduced to the tiny islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon.
The conflict is known by several names.
In British North America, wars were often named after the sitting British monarch, such as King William's War or Queen Anne's War.
Because there had already been a King George's War in the 1740s, British colonists named the second war in King George's reign after their opponents, and thus it became known as the French and Indian War.
This traditional name remains standard in the United States, although it obscures the fact that American Indians fought on both sides of the conflict.
American historians generally use the traditional name or the European title (the Seven Years' War), and have also invented other, less frequently used names for the war, including the Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire.
In Great Britain and France, the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War war usually has no special name, and so the entire worldwide conflict is known as the Seven Years' War (or the Guerre de sept ans).
The "Seven Years" refers to events in Europe, from the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763.
These dates do not correspond with the actual fighting in North America, where the fighting between the two colonial powers was largely concluded in six years, from the Jumonville Glen skirmish in 1754 to the capture of Montreal in 1760.
In Canada, both French- and English-speaking Canadians refer to it as the Seven Years' War (Guerre de Sept Ans) or the War of the Conquest (Guerre de la Conquête), since it is the war in which New France was conquered by the British and became part of the British Empire.
This war was also known as the Forgotten War.
There were numerous causes for the French and Indian War, which began less than a decade after France and Britain had fought on opposing sides in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748).
Both New France and New England wanted to expand their territories with respect to fur trading and other pursuits that matched their economic interests.
Using trading posts and forts, both the British and the French claimed the vast territory between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, known as the Ohio Country.
English claims resulted from royal grants which had no definite western boundaries.
The French claims resulted from La Salle's claiming the Mississippi River for France—its drainage area includes the Ohio River Valley.
In order to secure these claims, both European powers took advantage of Native American factions to protect their territories and to keep each other from growing too strong.
Newfoundland's Grand Banks were fertile fishing grounds and coveted by both sides.
The conclusion of this war would see France keeping only the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, allowing them access to the Grand Banks to this day.
The English colonists also feared papal influence in North America, as New France was administered by French governors and Roman Catholic hierarchy, and missionaries such as Armand de La Richardie were active during this period.
For the predominantly Protestant British settlers, French control over North America could have represented a threat to their religious and other freedoms provided by English law.
Likewise, the French feared the anti-Catholicism prevalent among English holdings.
In this period, Catholicism was still enduring persecution under English law.
In June 1747, Roland-Michel Barrin de La Galissonière, the Governor-General of New France, ordered Pierre-Joseph Céloron to lead an expedition to the Ohio Country with the objective of removing British influence from the area.
Céloron was also to confirm the allegiance of the Native Americans inhabiting the territory to the French crown.
Céloron's expedition consisted of 213 soldiers of the Troupes de la marine (French Marines), who were transported by 23 canoes.
The expedition left Lachine, on June 15, 1749, and two days later reached Fort Frontenac.
The expedition then continued along the shoreline of present-day Lake Erie.
At Chautauqua Portage (Barcelona, New York), the expedition moved inland to the Allegheny River.
The expedition headed south to the Ohio River at present-day Pittsburgh, and Céloron buried lead plates engraved with the French claim to the Ohio Country.
Whenever British merchants or fur-traders were encountered by the French, they were informed of the illegality of being on French territory and told to leave the Ohio Country.
When Céloron's expedition arrived at Logstown, the Native Americans in the area informed Céloron that they owned the Ohio Country and that they would trade with the British regardless of what the French told them to do.
The French continued their expedition.
At its farthest point south, Céloron's expedition reached the junction between the Ohio River and the Miami River.
The junction lay just south of the village of Pickawillany, where the Miami Chief, "Old Britain" (as styled by Céloron), lived.
When Céloron arrived at Pickawillany, he informed "Old Britain" of the "dire consequences" of the elderly chief continuing to trade with the British.
"Old Britain" ignored the warning.
After his meeting with Old Britain, Céloron and his expedition began the trip home.
They did not reach Montreal until November 10, 1749.
The best summary of the expedition's findings came from none other than Céloron himself.
In his report, Céloron wrote: "All I can say is that the Natives of these localities are very badly disposed towards the French, and are entirely devoted to the English.
I don't know in what way they could be brought back.

On March 17, 1752, the Governor-General of New France, Marquis de la Jonquière died.
His temporary replacement was Charles le Moyne de Longueuil.
It was not until July 1, 1752 that Ange Duquense de Menneville arrived in New France to take over the post.
In the spring of 1752, Longueuil dispatched an expedition to the Ohio River area.
The expedition was led by Charles Michel de Langlade, an officer in the Troupes de la marine.
Langlade was given 300 men comprised of members of the Ottawa and French-Canadians.
His objective was to punish the Miami people of Pickawillany for not following Céloron's orders to cease trading with the British.
At dawn on June 21, 1752, the French war party attacked the British trading centre at Pickawillany, killing fourteen people of the Miami nation, including "Old Britain".
The expedition then returned home.
In the spring of 1753, Paul Marin de la Malgue was given command of a 2,000 man force of Troupes de la Marine and Aboriginals.
His orders were to protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British.
Marin followed the route that Céloron had mapped out four years previously.
The main difference in the two expeditions was that, whereas Céloron had buried lead plates, Marin was constructing and garrisoning forts.
The first fort that was constructed by Paul Marin was Fort Presque Isle (Erie, Pennsylvania) on Lake Erie's south shore.
He then had a road built to the headwaters of Rivière aux Boeuf.
Marin then constructed a second fort at Le Boeuf (Waterford, Pennsylvania).
This fort was designed to guard the headwaters of the Rivière aux Boeuf.
On September 3, 1753, Tanaghrisson (d.
1754), Chief of the Mingo, arrived at Fort Le Boeuf.
Tanaghrisson hated the French because, as legend had it, the French had killed and eaten his father.
Tanaghrisson told Marin, "I shall strike at whoever.
.
.
", threatening the French.
The show of force by the French had alarmed the Iroquois in the area.
They sent Mohawk runners to William Johnson's manor in Upper New York.
Johnson, known to the Iroquois as "Warraghiggey", meaning "He who does big business", had become a respected member of the Iroquois Confederacy in the area.
In 1746, Johnson was made a colonel of the Iroquois, and later a colonel of the Western New York Militia.
At Albany, New York, there was a meeting between Governor Clinton of New York and Chief Hendrick, as well as other officials from a handful of American colonies.
Chief Hendrick insisted that the British abide by their obligations and block French expansion.
When an unsatisfactory response was offered by Clinton, Chief Hendrick proclaimed that the "Covenant Chain", a long-standing friendly relationship between the Iroquois Confederacy and the British Crown, was broken.
Governor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia found himself in a predicament.
Many merchants had invested heavily in fur trading in Ohio.
If the French made good on their claim to the Ohio Country and drove out the British, then the Virginian merchants would lose a lot of money.
Dinwiddie could not possibly allow the loss of the Ohio Country to France.
To counter the French military presence in Ohio, in October 1753 Dinwiddie ordered Major George Washington of the Virginia militia to deliver a message to the commander of the French forces in the Ohio Country, Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre.
Washington, along with his interpreter Jacob Van Braam and several other men, left for Fort Le Boeuf on the 31st of October.
A few days later, Washington and his party arrived at Wills Creek (Cumberland, Maryland).
Here Washington enlisted the help of Christopher Gist, a surveyor who was familiar with the area.
Washington and his party arrived at Logstown on November 24, 1753.
At Logstown, Washington met with Tanaghrisson, who was angry over the encroachment by the French military of his land.
Washington convinced Tanaghrisson to accompany his small group to Fort Le Boeuf.
On December 12, 1753, Washington and his men reached Fort Le Boeuf.
Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre invited Washington to dine with him that evening.
Over dinner, Washington presented Saint-Pierre with the letter from Dinwiddie that demanded an immediate French withdrawal from the Ohio Country.
Saint-Pierre was quite civil in his response, saying, "As to the Summons you send me to retire, I do not think myself obliged to obey it.
" The French explained to Washington that France's claim to the region was superior to that of the British, since René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle (1643–1687) had explored the Ohio Country nearly a century earlier.
Washington's party left Fort Le Boeuf early on December 16, 1753.
By January 16, 1754, they had arrived in Williamsburg, Virginia.
In his report, Washington stated, "The French had swept south.
" They had constructed and garrisoned forts at Presque Isle, Le Boeuf and Venango.
The French and Indian War was the last of four major colonial wars between the British, the French, and their Native American allies.
Unlike the previous three wars, the French and Indian War began on North American soil and then spread to Europe, where Britain and France continued fighting.
Britain officially declared war on France on May 15, 1756, marking the beginnings of the Seven Years' War in Europe.
Native Americans fought for both sides, but primarily alongside the French (with one exception being the Iroquois Confederacy, which sided with the American colonies and Britain).
The first major event of the war was in 1754.
Major George Washington, then twenty-one years of age, was sent to negotiate boundaries with the French, who did not give up their forts.
Washington led a group of Virginian (colonial) troops to confront the French at Fort Duquesne (present day Pittsburgh).
Washington stumbled upon the French at the Battle of Jumonville Glen (about six miles (10 km) NW of soon-to-be-established Fort Necessity [see below]), and in the ensuing skirmish, a French Officer (Joseph Coulon de Jumonville) was killed, news of which would have certainly provoked a strong French response.
Washington pulled back a few miles and established Fort Necessity.
The French forced Washington and his men to retreat.
Meanwhile, the Albany Congress was taking place as means to discuss further action.
Edward Braddock led a campaign against the French at Fort Duquesne in 1755; Washington was again among the British and colonial troops.
Braddock employed European tactics: bold, linear marches and firing formations.
This led to disaster at the Monongahela, where the French and natives, though heavily outmanned and outgunned (the British had a heavy cannon), used superior tactics (using the trees and bushes as cover) to gun down and rout the British.
Braddock was killed; Washington, despite four close calls, escaped unharmed and led the survivors in retreat.
This stunning British defeat heralded a string of major French victories over the next few years, at Fort Oswego, Fort William Henry, Fort Duquesne, and Carillon, where veteran Montcalm famously defeated five times his number.
The sole British successes in the early years of the war came in 1755, at the Battle of Lake George, which secured the Hudson Valley; and in the taking of Fort Beauséjour (which protected the Nova Scotia frontier) by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Monckton.
An unfortunate consequence of the latter was the subsequent forced deportation of the Acadian population of Nova Scotia and the Beaubassin region of Acadia.
The year 1756 brought with it William Pitt, Secretary of State of Great Britain.
His leadership, and France's continued neglect of the North-American theater, eventually turned the tide in favor of the British.
The French were driven from many frontier posts such as Fort Niagara, and the key Fortress Louisbourg fell to the British in 1758.
In 1759, the Battle of the Plains of Abraham gave Quebec City to the British, who had to withstand a siege there after the Battle of Sainte-Foy a year later.
In September of 1760, Pierre François de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal, the King's Governor of New France, negotiated a surrender with British General Jeffrey Amherst.
General Amherst granted Vaudreuil's request that any French residents who chose to remain in the colony would be given freedom to continue worshiping in their Roman Catholic tradition, continued ownership of their property, and the right to remain undisturbed in their homes.
The British provided medical treatment for the sick and wounded French soldiers and French regular troops were returned to France aboard British ships with an agreement that they were not to serve again in the present war.
Though most of the North American fighting ended on September 8, 1760, when the Marquis de Vaudreuil surrendered Montreal — and effectively all of Canada — to Britain (one notable late battle allowed the capture of Spanish Havana by British and colonial forces in 1762), the war officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763.
The treaty resulted in France's loss of all its North American possessions east of the Mississippi (all of Canada was ceded to Britain) except Saint Pierre and Miquelon, two small islands off Newfoundland.
France regained the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, which had been occupied by the British.
The economic value of these islands to France was greater than that of Canada at the time, because of their rich sugar crops, and the islands were easier to defend.
The British, however, were happy to take New France, as defence was not an issue, and they already had many sources of sugar.
Spain gained Louisiana, including New Orleans, in compensation for its loss of Florida to the British.
Also, Britain gained control of French Canada, a colony containing approximately 65,000 French-speaking, Roman Catholic residents.
Early in the war, in 1755, the British had expelled French settlers from Acadia (some of whom eventually fled to Louisiana, creating the Cajun population).
Now at peace, and eager to secure control of its hard-won colony, Great Britain found itself obliged to make concessions to its newly conquered subjects; this was achieved with the Quebec Act of 1774.
The history of the Seven Years' War, particularly the siege of Québec and the death of British Brigadier General James Wolfe, generated a vast number of ballads, broadsides, images, maps and other printed materials, which testify to how this event continued to capture the imagination of the British public long after Wolfe's death in 1759.
The European theatre of the war was settled by the Treaty of Hubertusburg on February 15, 1763.
The war changed economic, political, and social relations between Britain and its colonies.
It plunged Britain into debt, which the Crown chose to pay off with tax money from its colonies.
These taxes contributed to the beginning the American Revolutionary War.
